<p>This playground is based on <a href="https://sharplab.io">sharplab.io</a>'s editor. Visit <a href="https://github.com/ashmind/mirrorsharp">source code</a> on Github</p>

<p>Place your code here:</p>

<app-code-editor [code]="'Console.WriteLine();'"></app-code-editor>

<p>The editor is failing for some reason, while the code is actually fine. Don't worry, I'll fix it later!</p>

<button disabled>RUN</button>

<p>In future there will be an opportunity to directly run the code</p>
